#WDI Project 1 | Up the River Game

##User Stories
- As a group of players, I want to be able to start a new game with the proper setup.
- As a group of players, I want to be able to input each player upon starting a new game so that I can see names and cards for each person because drinking nicknames are fantastic.
- As a group of players, when I start a new game - I want to write a rule or punishment or randomly choose one.
- As a player, on my first turn I want to guess if my card will be red or black.
- As a player, on my second turn I want to guess if my card will be higher or lower than my first card.
- As a player, on my third turn I want to guess if my card will be “in between”, “outside”, or “on the fence” of my first two cards.
- As a player, on my fourth turn I want to guess what suit my card will be.
- As a player, I want to know if I won or lost the round. If I won I want to assign drinks to other people. If I lost I want to take drinks.
- As a group of players, after all four rounds are complete I want to see the cards on the river. If my cards match any of the cards in the left column I want to take drinks, if my cards match any of the cards in the right column I want to assign drinks to other players.
- As a group of players, I want to see the top card and if I have a card with the same value I will follow the rule or punishment.
- As a group of players, I want to play on a computer, tablet, and phone so that I can play anywhere.
- As a player, I want to see what cards other players have drawn so that I can try to make a better guess.
- As a player, I want an elegant design exeperience so that I would rather use this app than a deck of cards.
- As a player I want to be able to add more players mid way through the game
